# 🔐 Secure Authentication System

A **Secure Authentication System** designed to demonstrate modern, secure, and scalable login functionality using best practices in web security. This project focuses on protecting user credentials, handling authentication securely, and ensuring smooth communication between frontend and backend services.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Authentication is a critical part of any web application. This project implements a **secure login system** that validates users, protects sensitive data, and handles client–server communication safely. It is developed as an **academic project** with industry-relevant practices, making it suitable for evaluation, demonstrations, and portfolio use.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* To design a **secure and reliable authentication mechanism**
* To prevent common security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access
* To demonstrate proper **frontend–backend integration**
* To apply real-world concepts like REST APIs and secure data handling

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Fetch API)

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js

### Security & Utilities

* CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
* JSON-based API communication

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

```
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)
        ↓
   Fetch API (HTTP Requests)
        ↓
Backend (Node.js + Express)
        ↓
Authentication Logic
```

The frontend collects user credentials and sends them securely to the backend via REST APIs. The backend validates the credentials and returns appropriate responses.

---

## ✨ Features

* Secure user login functionality
* RESTful API-based authentication
* Proper error handling and validation
* CORS-enabled backend for safe cross-origin requests
* Clean and simple user interface

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-authentication-system.git
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
node clean-server.js
```

Server will start at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Frontend

Open the frontend using a local server (recommended):

* VS Code **Live Server** extension

Frontend URL example:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5500
```

## 🔍 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint     | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/api/login` | Authenticates user credentials |

---

## 🧪 Testing

* Backend tested using browser and Postman
* Frontend tested using Live Server
* Network and console logs used for debugging

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding of client–server architecture
* Practical knowledge of authentication workflows
* Experience with REST APIs and HTTP methods
* Improved debugging and error-handling skills

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Password hashing using bcrypt
* JWT-based authentication
* Database integration (MySQL / MongoDB)
* User registration and role-based access
* Deployment on cloud platforms
